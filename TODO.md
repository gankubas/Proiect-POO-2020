# Functional:
- [x] db of inventory, list, letters, cities
    - [x] populate list.dat, inventory.dat, letters.dat, cities.dat
        - [x] compiles, runs
            - [x] check file contents
        - [x] random generation
            - [x] make data generation file
            - [x] generate inventory
            - [x] generate wishlist
            - [x] generate list
            - [x] generate road graph
                - [x] ensure children have an associated city
            - [x] make letters and naughty list
                - [x] ensure letters have an associated child
    - [x] read from files to singleton database   
    - [x] select optimal generations for default example
